## 2026-10-05 — One-Step Latent Dynamics

Branch: `feat/latent-dynamics-one-step`

Research Question: Can observation-action history produce a latent state that improves one-step UAV dynamics prediction over a current-state-only Markov baseline?

Setup:

- Reused immutable `pi_hidden_state_seed0` mixed sequence dataset; 120 target groups, 840 episodes; no regeneration.
- Train/Val/Test: 588/126/126 episodes, 146631/30676/32296 valid transitions. Excluded each unavailable terminal next-observation transition.
- Seed0; 60 epochs; identical episode minibatches; train-only normalization; normalized delta7 MSE; validation-best selection.
- Markov MLP11→64→64→7; History GRU11→64 plus head68→64→64→7; PI-state Oracle MLP14→64→64→7. PI never enters History inputs/loss.

Key Results:

- Physical delta Test RMSE: Markov .0112404, History .00564894, Oracle .00959443 (mixed observation units).
- Dimensionless standardized RMSE: .605748 / .247433 / .540332. History improves physical RMSE 49.7% versus Markov.
- Gap closure 3.397 physical / 5.477 standardized; History beats this PI-state-only Oracle, which is not a full physical-state lower bound.
- Distance<.1m RMSE: .0040000 / .0004270 / .0015227; large-PI RMSE: .0166522 / .0083929 / .0146036.
- Frozen Train-fitted latent linear probe: Test PI RMSE .140976m/s², MAE .0737793, R² .525441.
- Latent norm mean/std/max 1.670/.475/4.033; finite, exact A→B→A reset, no memory leakage.

Conclusion: History-only dynamics supervision forms useful predictive latent state. It improves one-step prediction markedly, while only partially linearly encoding PI state. Improvement cannot be uniquely attributed to PI recovery.

Limitations: Nominal simulation, one seed, one-step only; larger recurrent parameter capacity; PI-only Oracle omits attitude/rates; near-target Test coverage is 431 transitions. No multi-step, policy optimization, robustness or planning experiment.

Artifacts: `mujoco/reports/latent_dynamics_one_step_seed0.json`; four representative PT models; five one-step/region/latent-probe PNGs under `mujoco/reports/`; detailed methods in `mujoco/rl/LATENT_DYNAMICS_ONE_STEP.md`. Raw NPZ and derived latent arrays stay local; manifests/hashes are versioned.

Next: Consider a separately authorized multi-step dynamics experiment to test whether the predictive state remains useful beyond one step. Do not automatically start it.

## 2026-10-05 — No-Memory GRU Ablation

Branch: `feat/latent-memory-ablation`, based on the pushed one-step experiment `ad2a7a2`.

Research Question: Does the one-step latent-dynamics gain depend on cross-time recurrent memory when GRU/head architecture and parameter initialization are held fixed?

Setup:

- Reused exact `pi_hidden_state_seed0` dataset/splits/statistics and raw delta7 target; no regeneration. Three previous models/report frozen by hash.
- Same GRU11→64, one layer, head68→64→64→7; identical seed0 parameter tensors/count23815. Each timestep starts with hidden zero in the No-Memory branch; previous executed action remains an explicit input.
- Same shared trainer: seed0, 60epochs, normalized masked MSE, episode minibatches/order, validation-best checkpoint. Only new No-Memory experimental model trained.

Key Results:

- No-Memory best epoch57; Test RMSE .01109201, MAE .00445811, R² .676758; normalized RMSE .598015.
- Markov RMSE .01124036; Full History .00564894; PI-state MLP .00959443.
- Full History improves49.07% physical /58.62% normalized RMSE versus No-Memory; No-Memory improves only1.32% /1.28% versus Markov.
- Distance<.1m RMSE: No-Memory .00409706 vs Full History .00042697. Large-PI RMSE: .01636837 vs .00839287.
- Zero cross-timestep input gradient and no influence of altered past inputs; all frozen-baseline metrics/hashes and train-only normalization reproduced.

Conclusion: Fixed architecture without recurrent memory loses nearly all of the previous gain. This supports cross-time memory as an important contributor under this seed/split, not architecture/parameter count alone.

Limitations: Single seed, nominal one-step only, explicit previous action still present, temporal paths naturally inactive with zero hidden, incomplete PI-only Oracle. No long-horizon or physical-generalization claim.

Artifacts: `mujoco/reports/latent_memory_ablation_seed0.json`; `mujoco/rl/models/history_latent_gru_no_memory.pt`; three `memory_ablation*.png`; methods in `mujoco/rl/LATENT_MEMORY_ABLATION.md`. No new raw dataset.

Next: A separately authorized frozen multi-step rollout evaluation is justified. Do not automatically execute it.

## 2026-10-06 — Frozen Multi-Step Latent Dynamics Evaluation

Branch: `feat/latent-multistep-eval`; base `9913006fe4f96a8be75a3bbc3a320be2744d0021` from memory ablation.

Research Question: Does the learned recurrent latent state remain useful during frozen multi-step autoregressive UAV dynamics prediction?

Setup:

- Four existing models frozen; exact `pi_hidden_state_seed0` Test only, 126 episodes/18 target groups; saved Train-only normalization, no fitting or resampling.
- Horizons1/5/10/25/50 at25Hz; all legal starts32296/31792/31162/29272/26122; same-model shared manifest. Endpoint observation-scaled RMSE, physical per-dimension RMSE/MAE, region and latent diagnostics.
- True initial observation, recorded future actions, predicted observation thereafter. Full-History uses true-prefix warm-up once then predicted inputs. PI-State reference receives teacher-forced PI, not full physical state.

Key Results:

- H1→H50 normalized observation RMSE: Markov .033368→.782929; No-Memory .033196→.757752; Full-History .021428→.279630; PI-State .029523→.517573.
- Full-History improves H50 RMSE63.10% versus No-Memory and64.28% versus Markov; identical26122-window curves preserve the ordering.
- H50 horizontal-velocity RMSE: .515912/.497372/.175199/.329847m/s in the above model order. PI-State has slightly lower vz error than History at long horizons.
- H50 large-PI normalized RMSE:1.043730/1.007968/.428217/.777787. Distance<.1m:.434934/.440057/.072944/.155229 (only80 eligible windows).
- History latent L2 drift grows0→.259558, cosine1→.983603; max norm4.03753. No NaN/Inf/explosion. Previous teacher-forced one-step metrics reproduced exactly.

Conclusion: Recurrent predictive latent remains useful beyond one step and slows error accumulation through2s; one-step superiority does not disappear in autoregression. Remaining compounding errors motivate a separately scoped multi-step training objective.

Limitations: Recorded future actions, nominal simulation, teacher-forced PI reference, single dataset/seed, correlated overlapping windows, at most2s and no model retraining. No closed-loop planning/control or complete-state claim.

Artifacts: `mujoco/reports/latent_dynamics_multistep_frozen_eval_seed0.json`; `latent_multistep_start_points_seed0.json`; six rollout/region/velocity/drift PNGs; methods in `mujoco/rl/LATENT_DYNAMICS_MULTISTEP_EVAL.md`. Existing model files/data stay immutable; no large prediction traces saved.

Next: Consider separately authorized multi-step latent dynamics training; do not automatically execute it or start a World Model/planner.
